    "### 1.1. Business Problem:\n",
    "Used the Foursquare API and London data to cluster neighborhoods and determine the best location for the delivery workers of an online food ordering company.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Background:\n",
    "Online food ordering is a system to order the restaurants' food through the website or mobile app. Based on the type of this system, a customer can choose a restaurant, scan the menu items, select the desired items and pay it. These websites give customers information about the food, price, duration of the food preparation and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the reports, the online food ordering market have significantly increased all over the world. For instance, 40 percent of Americans having ordered their food online at least once.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of online food ordering. One of the main ones is managed by online food delivery companies. In this method, these companies receive the costumer order on their website or mobile app and connect the costumer to the restaurant. After that the costumer ordered and payed the food, they can get the food in door. This is done with some delivery workers (normally with motorcycle or bicycle) who working for the online food delivery companies and are supposed to transfer the food from the restaurants to the costumer's house or office. Naturally, these delivery companies work with lots of restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is seriously important for the delivery companies is that they should deliver the food as soon as possible, in order to reduce the delivery time, increase customer's satisfaction, and get more orders. Therefore, it is noticeably vital for these companies to arrange their delivery workers to save the time. To do so, the location of the delivery workers should be optimized in order to reduce the distance they have to drive each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind this project is to cluster the neighborhoods of the city (here London is chosen as the case study) to ensure that the workers have to drive less distance in each area. In this project, the data of the restaurants’ location and the population of each area of the city is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is useful for all the online food delivery companies who would like to increase their performance and profit."

    "## 5. Results and Discussion\n",
    "The analysis indicates that although there are 33 boroughs in London having different food venues and population, some of these areas are more crowded in comparison to the other ones. Moreover, the density of the food venues in these areas are completely different. This analysis demonstrates the importance of this survey for the stakeholders. Also, it clarified that this diversity among the areas can widely influence the density and location of delivery workers in the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get the best results, the k-means method is used to clustering the neighborhoods into 8 clusters. The areas  were illustrated in the map categorizing in the groups with various colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "As indicated in the \"Population\" figure, the crowded areas are clusters labeled 3 and 2, while the clusters labeled 4, 6 ad 7 have the least population. Obviously, the other clusters are in the middle. If we consider only the population of each area, the results show that the crowded areas could be potentially good places to arrange the most delivery workers, but it is not the only case we should consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, there is another factor that could be considered that is the number of food venues (restaurants, cafes, fast foods, ...). Generally, we expect that those areas with more venues need more online services. As illustrated in the \"Number of Venues\" figure, cluster 0 and cluster 3 have the most food venues, while clusters 4, 6 and 7 have the least ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, if we consider the two variables (\"population\" and \"number of food venues\") one by one, it could give us a good estimation, but not a perfect result. Because, the high number of food venues in an area cannot guarantee that the more people would like use online services, number of food venues itself could not be a variable with a hundred percent accuracy. Moreover, if an area has more population, it does not ensure that alway more restaurants and fast foods are there. Therefore, to estimate the tendency of the customers for ordering online food, it is necessary to evaluate both variables in each area together. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final results provided in the scatter plot reveals the relation between \"population\" and \"number of food venues\" in each neighborhood. As we can see, the best place to integrate the workers is cluster 3 (neighborhoods: Bromley, Ealing, Enfield, Hammersmith and Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea, Kingston upon Thames, Merton, Richmond upon Thames, Sutton, Tower Hamlets, Wandsworth). After that, we recommend that the company focuses on cluster 2 (neighborhoods: Bexley, Brent, Croydon, Greenwich, Harrow, Hillingdon, Redbridge), cluster 0 (neighborhoods: City of London, Camden, Islington, Lambeth, Southwark, Westminster) and cluster 5 (neighborhoods: Barnet, Hackney, Haringey, Newham). The other areas are less important."

    "## 6. Conclusion\n",
    "The scope of this project was to identify London areas with high number of food venues in order to assist online food orering stakeholders in narrowing down the search for optimal location for arranging delivery workers. By calculating restaurant density distribution from Foursquare data we have first identified general boroughs that justify further analysis, then generated extensive collection of locations considering the population of each area. Clustering of those locations was then performed in order to create major zones of interest."
